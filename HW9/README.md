1. I worked with Colin and Jonathan
2. Colin did a lot the coding. I just asked a million questions and provided some ideas/coding insight.
3. I learned:
    - How to make an encoder.
    - How much different optimizers and different learning rates can improve the model.
    - How to export individual layers from a model for testing.
    - Pandas merging and dropping.
