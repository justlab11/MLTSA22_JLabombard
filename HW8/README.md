1. I worked with Jonathan and Colin.
2. We all did the coding and bounced ideas off of each other. 
3. I learned:
    - More about the groupby function and its applications
    - Any interpolation algorithm is not great when there are large gaps in the data
    - Cubic interpolation can provide some extreme maximums/minimums on occasion
