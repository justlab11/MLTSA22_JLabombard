1. I worked by myself.
2. I did all of the coding.
3. I learned:
    - A bit about lightcurves and what they are used for.
    - Feature extraction for different sections of data.
    - How to use the groupby function to look at segments of data.
    - A bit about Gaussian Processes and how they're used.
