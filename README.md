# PHYS 667: Machine Learning Time Series Analysis
This repository is for my introduction into machine learning on time series data. Hopefully you will see an improvement over time with more complex topics as time goes on.

Each readme inside the homework will contain:
1. Who I worked with
2. What I did for the code
3. What did I learn and what was the topic
